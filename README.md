# Machine-Learning-for-Water-Optical-Properties-Using-Satellite-Imagery

This work was presented at the [International Ocean Colour Science Meeting](https://iocs.ioccg.org/iocs-2023-meeting/) in November 2023, at St. Petersburg, USA.

The work focuses on predicting the chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration by regression analysis, using variables extracted from level-4 satellite data. The parameters extracted are sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height (SSH), wind velocity and direction, total suspended solids (TSM), visible bands from Sentinel-3 imagery (red, green and blue bands). The parameters are used to predict cholorophyll-a  concentration (chl-a).
